<h2>5. Serving a React website</h2>
<p>React is a powerful tool for creating website interfaces.</p>
<p>
  But when it comes to a React website's server, there are several options to consider
  <sup><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains" target="_blank" class="blue link">[1]</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>Below are, in my opinion, the two main options for modern websites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <span class="blue bold">static website</span></li>
  <li>A <span class="blue bold">single page web app</span></li>
</ul>

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Serving a <span class="blue bold">static website</span></h3>
<p>
  A static website is a website where pages are served to browsers exactly the way they're stored on the server
  <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page" class="blue link" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
  Static websites are generally easy to serve. A service like NginX can be used to map URL routes to HTML pages in a file tree,
  and load other assets in a simlar way.
</p>
<br/>
<p>You can use ReactJS with a static website -- just link the React scripts in your code, and you can use React tools in whatever JavaScript you add.</p>
<p>You can also use JSX to build a static website, with Babel.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  React's official website recommends<sup><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#gatsby" class="blue link" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
  the service Gatsby. Gatsby is a framework that provides all the React features, and also bundles your code with Webpack, so it will run faster in the browser.
</p>
<p>
  Gatsby also provides templated React components and page layouts for you to use, and other features, like GraphQL set up. 
</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Serving a <span class="blue bold">single page web app</span></h3>
<p>
  A single page app, or SPA, is a website design pattern where the website loads a single HTML file, 
  and any other page route content is then loaded into that HTML file, without actually reloading the page 
  <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" class="blue link">[4]</a></sup>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  This set up has a few advantages.  For one thing, it's easy to reuse the same website header and navigation links, 
  while still having many different pages with different content. 
</p>
<p>
  A SPA website doesn't reload completely between page route changes, which means transitions between pages can be faster and smoother.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  You'll hear a lot about <i>server-side rendering</i> versus <i>client-side rendering</i> with SPAs.  With server-side rendering, an
  SPA will load the entire website, including the route page's contents, the first time the page loads.
</p>
<p>
  Server-side rendering is better than client-side rendering, where the base page is sent to the browser, which then makes
  an additional call to the server to load the route's content. 
</p>
<p>
  However, once the website is initially loaded, when the user navigates to a new page, <i>both</i> strategies 
  will load the route page's content from the server, and render it client-side.  That's simply how SPAs work. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  React's website recommends<sup><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#nextjs">[5]</a></sup> NextJS for building
  single-page apps, a framework for server-side rendering.  
</p>
<p>NextJS is built on NodeJS, and provides "styling and routing solutions".</p>
<br/>
<p>
  I should mention that this website is a client-side rendered SPA app that doesn't 
  use NextJS. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm using my own simple NodeJS set up to serve the initial index.html file,
  and then a browser script to make calls back to the server to load individual route pages.
