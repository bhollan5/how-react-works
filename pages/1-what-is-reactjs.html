<br/>
<p>There are lots of options for how to design a website. The React "framework" gives you some powerful tools to help get you started.</p>
<br/>
<p>React lets users build "reactive" web pages, where changes to a single peice of data can propagate to multiple areas. </p>
<br/>
<p>Here's a very basic example of ReactJS in use: </p>
<p>Edit the name in the text box on the left, and watch the components  on the right immediately "react" to the changes.</p>

<div class="flex" id="demo-1">
  <div class="demo-1-container">
    <div>
      <div>Enter your name</div>
      <input type="text" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="demo-1-container">
    <div>Your name is <b>8</b> characters long.</div>

  </div>
