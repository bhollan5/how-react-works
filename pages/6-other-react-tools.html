<h2>6. Other React tools</h2>
<p>Aside from server tools, React can be used with several other tools.</p>
<p>On this page, I'll describe two popular tools that work well with React, and how they can be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strongly typed JS with <span class="blue bold">TypeScript</span></li>
  <li>UI design tools with <span class="blue bold">Material UI</span></li>
</ul>

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Strongly typed JS with <span class="blue bold">TypeScript</span></h3>
<p>
  TypeScript is an extension of the JavaScript language that allows programmers to specify datatypes of variables.
  This means that TypeScript is considered a "strongly typed" language. 
</p>
<p>
  TypeScript's official docs have a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html" target="_blank" class="blue link">page</a>
  all about using TypeScript with various React setups. 
</p>

<h3>UI design tools with <span class="blue bold">Material UI</span></h3>
<p>Material UI is a library of styled, functional React components, ready to be used in any React app.</p>
<p>
  The Material UI <a href="https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/" target="_blank" class="blue link">website</a> 
  provides straightforward instructions for adding Material UI to your website.
</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<p>
  There are other tools and libraries that can be added to a ReactJS website, but for now, I'll leave it at those two.
