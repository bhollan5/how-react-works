<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to www.how-react.works. This website contains a guide to React, written by a person who is relatively new to React.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  You may want to check out the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">React documentation</a> 
  or the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a>.
  I wrote this website's content by reading those tutorials, and re-writing the information I found most pertinant.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Unlike the official docs, I include working examples of React features on the website pages, rather than in separate codepen links. 
</p>
<p>This guide is also shorter than the official docs. </p>
<br/>
<p>The first part of this website's guide is title <span onclick="goto('1-what-is-reactjs')" class="blue link">1. What is ReactJS?</span></p>
