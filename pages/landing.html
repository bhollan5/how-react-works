<p>This website contains a guide to React, written by a person who is relatively new to React. </p>
<br/>
<p>
  You may want to check out the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">React documentation</a> 
  or the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>There are lots of other React tutorials out there as well.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  This website will aim to be brief, clear, and practical.  Unlike the official docs, I'll be including working examples of React features. 
  I'll also be skimming over a lot of the nitty-gritty that they cover.
